1. The class that used to implement the controller pattern in this library is snappingSheetController. It allows the developer to add snap positions and to move the sheet to a certain position and also to retrieve info about the sheet(for example if it is snapping).
2. The parameter that controls this behavior is curve(and also duration for the duration of the snapping) which controls the behavior of the ssnapping.
3. Inkwell has the ripple effect tap which GestureDetector does'nt have, but GestureDetector provides more controls than Inkwell, for example dragging.
